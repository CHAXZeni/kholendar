# kholendar
The **Kholendar** is a calendar with 24 months, each with 15 days. Each week has 5 days and at the beginning of every year, there is an additional week called The Week of Awn.In total there are 365 days in each year. This is **ALL MADE UP** and heavily inspired by the books I was reading at the time (The Stormlight Archive).

 From this idea, I made a python calendar app which allows you to view and interact with the Kholendar. There is a python backend which supports a python GUI. In the GUI you can create a user, add events to the calendar, and browse the different months of the Kholendar. 

 The user and event creation is all stored in a JSON file and processed using Python.

## Running The GUI
- Install python.
- Install the dependencies using pip.
- Run the *main.py* file.
